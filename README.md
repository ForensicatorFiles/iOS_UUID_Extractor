# iOS UUID Extractor

## Overview
The **iOS UUID Extractor** is a GUI-based Python application built with `customtkinter` that allows users to extract UUIDs and metadata identifiers from iOS filesystem ZIP files. This tool is tailored for analyzing app data and app group UUIDs from iOS backups or filesystem images. It offers a clean, modern user interface with options to filter results and export them to a JSON file.

---

## Features
- **File Selection:** Easily select ZIP files containing iOS filesystem data.
- **Results Display:** View extracted UUIDs and metadata in a scrollable text area.
- **Filtering:** Filter results by a keyword for focused analysis.
- **Export Results:** Save the extracted or filtered results as a JSON file.
- **Clear Filter:** Reset the filter to redisplay the complete results.
- **Custom Theme:** Uses a "90s Retro" custom theme for a unique visual style.

### Custom Theme
The application uses a 90s_retro_theme_full.json custom theme for customtkinter. Replace this theme file or modify it for a personalized look.

To switch to another theme:
- Replace the theme file path in the code:
``` python
ctk.set_default_color_theme("blue")
```

---

### Project Structure
- `ios_uuid_extractor.py`: Main application file.
- `90s_retro_theme_full.json`: Custom theme file.

---

Limitations
- Only processes ZIP files with specific iOS directory structures:
  - `private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application`
  - `private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup`
- The file selection is manual (drag-and-drop is not supported).
